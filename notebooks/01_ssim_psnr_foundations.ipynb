    "# Can You Predict SSIM from PSNR? Let’s Find Out\n",
    "\n",
    "The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is a simple metric. It measures the average squared error between two images and turns it into a logarithmic scale. It's fast, cheap and easy to compute\n",
    "\n",
    "The Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), on the other hand, is more perceptually motivated. It looks at local structure, contrast, and luminance. It operates window by window. It feels more sophisticated and refined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, PSNR and SSIM are often treated as fundamentally different metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "But are they?\n",
    "- What if PSNR actually contains more structural information than we usually assume?\n",
    "- What if SSIM can be predicted, or at least _approxSSIMated_, from PSNR and statistics of the reference image?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Revisit the mathematical definitions of PSNR and SSIM\n",
    "- Visualize how they behave on compression-based distortions\n",
    "- Walk through the key assumptions behind their relationship\n",
    "- Translate those assumptions directly into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a formal paper (I already wrote one of those), this is a guided exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basics."
